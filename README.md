# DIABETES-PREDICTION-MODEL
The objective of these project is to diagnostically predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements like Glucose, BloodPressure, Insulin, Age etc .

• Developed a Binary Classification model to predict diabetes risk using ML & Deep Learning techniques.

• Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Matplotlib and Seaborn, analyzing data distributions, correlations, skewness, and outliers.

• Applied data preprocessing, feature scaling (MinMaxScaler & StandardScaler), and outlier detection for data optimization.

• Utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, selecting the most relevant features for better model efficiency.

• Implemented Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest, and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to compare performance.

• Evaluated models using Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, and F1-score for optimal selection.

• Successfully implemented Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) using TensorFlow/Keras to enhance model accuracy.

• Documented the entire project workflow, ensuring reproducibility and scalability for future model improvements.
